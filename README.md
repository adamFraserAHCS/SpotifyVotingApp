# SpotifyVotingApp

this is an app for the MCHS leavers prom of 2019.

it uses a redit style voting system to democraticaclly decide the order of the song playlist. 
songs can be added (and also upvoted) with a search functionality provided by spotify.

there are 2 distinct parts to this project.
* the app
* the server & DJ

the app is based on web-technologies for the sake of compatibility as is the server.
since this is not a professional application it has been bodged together especially on the server side.
